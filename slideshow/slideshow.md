# Coding isn’t a career: it’s a skill

- Just like writing, reading, and math: you use coding to get things done
--

- This means two things:
  - Programmers can be found in many, many different areas
  - Lots of people who aren’t “coders” can use coding as a tool

# Introduction

Here's some code:

```python
def whats_up(hotdog):
    # Comment
    return {
        "catchphrase": "whats up hotdog",
*        "rating": 80,
        "keep": False
    }
```
